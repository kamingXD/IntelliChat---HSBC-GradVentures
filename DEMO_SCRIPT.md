# IntelliChat - 1.5 Minute Demo Script

**(Start of script - ~90 seconds)**

---

Hello everyone, and welcome. Today, I'm excited to introduce IntelliChat, a smart, conversational financial assistant designed to provide personalized advice.

**(Screen shows the product selection page)**

Right from the start, the user experience is clean and focused. Built with **Next.js** and **React**, the interface is fast and responsive. We've used **Tailwind CSS** and **ShadCN UI** components to create a modern, trustworthy design that aligns with the HSBC brand aesthetic.

A user begins by selecting a financial topic they're interested in, like "Loans" or "Credit Cards."

**(Click on a product, navigate to the chat screen)**

This takes them directly into a dedicated chat session. The core of IntelliChat is its powerful conversational AI. We're using **Google's Gemini model**, orchestrated through **Genkit**, to power the chat.

As I ask a question, you'll see the response streams back in real-time, creating a natural, fluid conversation.

**(Type a message like "What's the best credit card for travel?" and send it)**

Notice these suggestion chips that appear? Genkit analyzes the conversation and intelligently suggests relevant next steps, making it easy for the user to guide the dialogue without a lot of typing.

The entire chat history is automatically saved. Users can easily switch between conversations or delete old ones from this collapsible sidebar on the left.

**(Show the sidebar with multiple chats, maybe delete one)**

In summary, IntelliChat combines a modern **Next.js** frontend with the power of **Google's Gemini AI** to create an intuitive and intelligent financial assistant that's ready to help customers anytime, anywhere.

Thank you.
